## work in progress

Every cleaning operation was meticulously documented along with a concise description highlighting its purpose, implementation, and the rationale behind its choice. These operations were compiled into tables, incorporating the regular symbol expression \textit{.*?} to depict an undefined sequence of words, numbers, and/or graphic symbols.

Furthermore, any text found in the \textit{Subject} section was retained in its entirety, including spaces, while any our annotations were enclosed within brackets that were not present in the TLA dataset, specifically \textit{(£ £)}.

The meanings of cleaned characters were primarily derived from the MdC~\citep{MdC} conventions, while others were extracted from the Berlin Text System 3.1 (V 3.0) user manual~\citep{berlin_text_system}.

The management of translations is documented in Table x***, while the handling of transliterations is recorded in Table y***. The processing of Gardiner code is detailed in Table z***, and the treatment of parts of speech is presented in Table k***.
